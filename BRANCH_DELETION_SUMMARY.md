# Branch Deletion Task Summary

## Task
Discard and delete the branch `copilot/fix-144e10d6-34c0-49f8-ad7d-e29e29a791be`

## Status
⚠️ **Manual Action Required**

## What Was Done

Due to authentication and permission constraints in the sandboxed environment, I cannot directly:
- Close pull requests via GitHub API or CLI
- Delete remote branches via git push commands
- Execute GitHub operations that require write permissions

Instead, I have prepared:

1. **DELETE_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Detailed instructions with three different approaches to delete the branch
2. **scripts/delete-branch.sh** - An executable script that automates the deletion process when run with proper credentials

## Branch Details

- **Branch Name**: `copilot/fix-144e10d6-34c0-49f8-ad7d-e29e29a791be`
- **Associated PR**: #1 - "Verify and document GitHub Actions workflow test configuration"
- **PR Status**: Open (Draft)
- **Branch SHA**: `77c8b7c9186888c827413b90a8fd5ff84dfc8a11`
- **Base Branch**: `main`

## How to Complete the Task

### Quick Method (GitHub UI)
1. Go to https://github.com/iammultiman/baseline-analyzer/pull/1
2. Click "Close pull request" (do not merge)
3. Click "Delete branch" when prompted

### Automated Method (Command Line)
Run the provided script:
```bash
./scripts/delete-branch.sh
```

This script will:
- Detect if GitHub CLI (gh) is available
- Prompt for confirmation before actions
- Close the PR and delete the branch
- Handle both remote and local branch cleanup

### Manual Method (Git Commands)
```bash
# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-144e10d6-34c0-49f8-ad7d-e29e29a791be

# Close PR manually via GitHub UI
```

## Files Created

- `DELETE_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Comprehensive deletion guide
- `scripts/delete-branch.sh` - Automated deletion script
- `BRANCH_DELETION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps

Someone with write access to the repository should:
1. Review this summary and the deletion instructions
2. Execute the deletion using one of the provided methods
3. Verify the branch and PR are removed
4. Optionally remove these temporary documentation files after completion

## Notes

- The branch to be deleted is not the current working branch
- No code changes are required - only branch management
- The PR contains workflow test verification documentation but has been marked for removal
