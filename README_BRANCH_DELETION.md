# üóëÔ∏è Branch Deletion Task - Action Required

## Quick Summary

This PR prepares for the deletion of branch `copilot/fix-144e10d6-34c0-49f8-ad7d-e29e29a791be` and its associated PR #1.

## ‚ö° Quick Action

**Easiest Method - GitHub UI:**
1. Visit: https://github.com/iammultiman/baseline-analyzer/pull/1
2. Click "Close pull request" (do not merge)
3. Click "Delete branch" when prompted

**Alternative - Use the Script:**
```bash
./scripts/delete-branch.sh
```

## üìã What This PR Contains

Three documentation files to help complete the branch deletion:

1. **BRANCH_DELETION_SUMMARY.md** - Overview and status of the task
2. **DELETE_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Detailed step-by-step instructions
3. **scripts/delete-branch.sh** - Automated deletion script

## üîç Why Documentation Instead of Direct Deletion?

The Copilot agent environment has security constraints that prevent:
- Direct GitHub API write operations
- Git push operations for branch deletion  
- Closing PRs programmatically

Therefore, I've created comprehensive documentation and an automation script that you can execute with proper credentials.

## ‚úÖ After Deletion

Once you've deleted the branch and closed PR #1, you can optionally:
1. Clean up these temporary documentation files:
   - `BRANCH_DELETION_SUMMARY.md`
   - `DELETE_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - `scripts/delete-branch.sh`
   - `README_BRANCH_DELETION.md`

2. Close or merge this PR (whichever is appropriate for your workflow)

## üìñ Full Details

See `BRANCH_DELETION_SUMMARY.md` for complete details about the branch to be deleted and all available deletion methods.
