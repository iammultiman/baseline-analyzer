**Key Features:**
- Atomic transactions using Prisma transactions
- Configurable pricing parameters
- Usage limit enforcement for free tier users
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Credit Management APIs
- `GET /api/credits` - Retrieve credit balance, history, and usage stats
- `GET /api/credits/packages` - Get available credit packages
- `POST /api/credits/purchase` - Process credit purchases (demo mode)
- `POST /api/credits/calculate` - Calculate analysis cost

#### Admin APIs
- `GET/PUT /api/admin/pricing` - Manage pricing configuration
- `GET /api/admin/usage` - Usage analytics and statistics

#### User Registration
